Queries
=======

iommi queries makes it easy to implement searching and filtering in your Django app.

Major features:

- Generate simple filtering GUIs
- Supply your views with an advanced query language
- Query language can be used stand alone without the GUI parts
- Highly customizable GUI based on iommi :doc:`forms`

Queries are normally used from inside iommi tables where they are an
integrated part, but can also be used stand alone. See below for an
example.

.. image:: queries_example.png

The code for the example above:

.. code-block:: python

    Table(
        auto__model=Album,
        page_size=10,
        columns__name__filter__include=True,
        columns__artist__filter__include=True,
    )

Read the full documentation and the :doc:`cookbook` for more.

Query language
--------------

iommi comes with an advanced query language so users can filter tables
after what they want. Searching songs can look like this:

.. code-block::

    album=Paranoid AND lyrics:"have the power"

This will find the song War Pigs, as it's from the album Paranoid and
the lyrics contains the text "have the power". The query language supports
`AND` and `OR`, parenthesis and the operations `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` for
numerical values, and `=` for all values which is an exact case insensitive
match. You can exclude with `!=`. As the example above shows `:` is used for
case insensitive "contains" queries, and the inverse of that is `!:`.

iommi tries to support what the user might intuitively write for searching
boolean columns. It will interpret "n", "no", "0" (zero), "false", "f" and "off"
as `false`  and the corresponding values for `true`.

You can configure a `Filter` to be case sensitive by setting `query_operator_to_q_operator`
to `case_sensitive_query_operator_to_q_operator`.

iommi queries have a special form for filtering directly on pk, which can be
very handy: `album.pk=3`.

`query_operator_for_field` specifies what operation the simple form uses to
interpret its inputs. The default is `=`, meaning exact case insensitive match.

If you have table of `Song` and a foreign key to `Album`, if you search for
`album=Paranoid` iommi will by default create the Django query
`Q(album__name='Paranoid')`. If your model has different fields used as names,
you must register those with `register_search_fields`, or if you want
something other special for just this view you can use the `search_fields`
parameter to specify the fields to use. Note that you can use `pk` or
other non-string columns as search fields if you want.

Stand alone example
-------------------

Simple view that allows the user to search for an album by choosing the artist from a drop down, and search
for specific year in the advanced mode:

.. code-block:: python

    class AlbumQuery(Query):
        artist = Filter.choice_queryset(choices=Artist.objects.all())
        year = Filter.integer()

    def albums(request):
        query = AlbumQuery().bind(request=request)

        dispatch = query.perform_dispatch()
        if dispatch is not None:
            return dispatch

        return render(
            request=request,
            template_name='albums.html',
            context={
                'query': query,
                'albums': query.get_q(),
            },
        )

.. code-block:: html

    <!-- albums.html -->
    {{ query }}

    <ul>
        {% for album in albums %}
            <li>{{ album }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>

You will also need to render the assets in your `<head>` tag:



.. code-block:: html

    {% for asset in query.iommi_collected_assets.values %}
        {{ asset }}
    {% endfor %}

.. raw:: html

    <div class="iframe_collapse" onclick="toggle('06551ccf-bc17-4655-8bef-7c45e9ebabd3', this)">â–¼ Hide result</div>
    <iframe id="06551ccf-bc17-4655-8bef-7c45e9ebabd3" src="doc_includes/queries/test_stand_alone_example.html" style="background: white; display: ; width: 100%; min-height: 100px; border: 1px solid gray;"></iframe>

Programmatically call the search API:

.. code-block:: python

    query = Query(auto__model=Album).bind(request=request)
    albums_queryset = query.parse_query_string(
        'artist="Black Sabbath" and (year=1991 or year=1992)'
    )
